Challenge 1

    Write a function called linear_search_product that takes the list of 
    products and a target product name as input. The function should perform a 
    linear search to find the target product in the list and return a list of 
    indices of all occurrences of the product if found, or an empty list if the
    product is not found.

Challenge 2

    Implement a function called sort_students that takes a list of student 
    objects as input and sorts the list based on their CGPA (Cumulative Grade 
    Point Average) in descending order. Each student object has the following 
    attributes: name (string), roll_number (string), and cgpa (float). Test the
    function with different input lists of students.
